License Aside
-------------
NB: It is assumed that the attribution requirement of the MIT license is sufficient to cover attribution requirements of CC-BY-4.0 (from earlier versions); however, some changelog or list of changes will still be necessary to fulfill the changes documenting requirement from cc-by-4.0 . To that end, this project would chiefly refer to to git commit log (with some supplementing documentation in the changelog itself) as a list of changes to the source work. Projects deriving from this one are left to their own devices on the matter.

Version 0.52.1
==============

J. "greysondn" L. licensed version 0.52.1 as CC-BY-4.0

You may find the license at < https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ >

Changes were made to the structure of the project by Greysondn but he claims that otherwise the work is overwhelmingly that of SillySnowFox

Therefore attribution requires are mandatory for the name SillySnowFox and optional for the name "greysondn".

"SillySnowFox" licensed version 0.52 as CC-BY-4.0

You may find the license at < https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ >
