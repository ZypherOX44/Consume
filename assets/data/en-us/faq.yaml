  q: >-
    The game really, really sucks now! What is even going on with this anymore?
  a: >-
    Genko's code was a real mess. Instead of trying to work with it, I decided
    to port the core game and redesign it to be more tolerable. (Greysondn, 7

  q: >-
    Who are you anyway? Why did you take this project over?
  a: >-
    My name is pretty insignificant in the grand scheme. I studied a lot of game
    design and am a fan of older text adventure games, and Consume always
    bothered me in that arena but I felt that there was no reason to poke it
    until recent when it was declared abandoned. My reasons are somewhat myriad
    and not all pure; in the long run, I'm hoping to make enough money and
    design a text interpreter to step from here to releasing more conventional
    games. (Greysondn, 7 February 2019)

    Make money? How?
  a: >-
    More likely than not, Patreon or donations on this specific project. This
    isn't exactly storefront friendly material, after all. But the engine could
    be used to make games that could be more viable, I think, as long as I
    design it right. (Greysondn, 7 February 2019)

  q: >-
    Are you going to write in new content? More scenes of the player being
    eaten? More types of vore?
  a: >-
    I haven't ruled this out, but it's not on my list just yet. The first
    priority MUST be to get the game in a more maintainable state. If that
    happens, then even if I abandon it someone else would find it easier to pick
    up and fiddle with later on. So given that, everything else is on the back
    burner until the porting process is done. (Greysondn, 7 February 2019)

    Will there be [insert type of vore]? Will there be [insert species]?

    No promises. See above question. TBD. Etc.  (Greysondn, 7 February 2019)

    Will there be graphics? Can I make graphics for the game?

    This question is shelved. Please see the question two above. (Greysondn, 7

  q: >-
    Can I write scenes then?
  a: >-
    Much like the above answers, I don't want to try to slide in new content
    while I'm working on the port. Wait for now. There will come a point I'm
    open to contributions and write a guide for people to follow. (Greysondn, 7

  q: >-
    Can I pay for this game? Who should I pay, even?
  a: >-
    I guess that gets complicated to follow, but basically, I hope I eventually
    reach a point where I can say I've done enough work and paying me isn't a
    sin. For now? I'd suggest probably nobody; I'm the one currently working on
    this, and I'm not taking money until I feel I've earned it. (Greysondn, 7

    What did you use to make Consume's HaxeFlixel port?
  a: >-
    Haxe, and Haxeflixel. Genko seems to have not understood the ecosystem very
    well. I've had years of experience in it, and I've been working with Flixel
    longer than there's been a Haxe port of it. The IDE is VS-Code; the platform
    of choice is (regretably) Windows 10. Game testing is done via a debug build
    for HTML5, running in Google Chrome. Beyond this, it's just a difference in
    experience - not, I think, in ability. (Greysondn, 7 February 2019)

  q: >-
    Why is it called a WaTTY?
  a: >-
    Very few people will come to this question, but there is a category of
    people who will. Wa is Japanese for bad, and a TTY is a text interface used
    for extremely old machinery and text-to-speech systems. The joke here is
    that it's not a very good TTY (it's not, it just gets the job done)... and
    also I get to name every instance of WaTTY a wat for extra points, because
    wat is even going on anymore. (Greysondn, 7 February 2019)

    Will you reopen the Reddit community? Or start your own?
  a: >-
    Reddit really doesn't like when a banned subreddit changes its name and
    reopens. I suggest not doing that. (Greysondn, 7 February 2019)

    Check the FA description for a Discord server.

  q: >-
    How many lines are left to port from the old codebase to the new one?
  a: >-
    There used to be a listing of this, but I let it slip so far out of date
    that I'll just leave it at more than zero for now. (Greysondn, 28 May 2019)
