      The bedroom of your tiny 2-room apartment. It's really only it's own room
      becuase of the divider seperating it from the rest of the apartment, there 
      isn't even a door.
      
      Contains all the normal bedroom stuff; bed, dirty clothes, clean clothes.
      A dresser that gets used less then it should. There's a rather nice sized
      closet that's currently stuffed so full of junk you don't feel safe
      opening the door.

      The street outside your apartment. Three identical buildings sit side-by-side here, they all share a single parking lot accessed by an alley. The lot is really too small for the number of apartments in the buildings but that's never bothered you since you don't have a car. Up the road a short distance from here is what's best described as the 'market district' of this small town. Across from your building is the local park, the woods always look like it would be easy to get lost in them, even during the day. Down the road away from town is the new construction that's been going up, including the new club that just opened.

      What is probably best referred to as the town's market district. It's rather depressing really, there is only a single general store here, located in a tiny building to the east. Across the street to the west is a modern gym, you've never gone inside it before, but perhaps now it would be worth it to take a peek inside. North of here the road heads out of town eventually leading to the highway and the rest of the country. Before it gets that far, and still within walking distance, sits the town's hospital.

A door next to the desk is marked &quot;Members Only&quot; and seems to lead into the main workout area, visible from outside though the large floor to ceiling windows along the street facing wall. A keycard reader next to the door ensures only those with the proper access can get in the building.

The machines also seem to be grouped and numbered, it looks like if you pick a group and follow the numbers in sequence you'll get a good workout in that area.</p><br><p>The back wall of the room is a large mirror, both letting you see yourself working out and giving the illusion that the room is much larger then it appears. There are three doors in the room, the first heads back out through the reception area and then outside. Across the room from that is another door secured with a card reader, it has a sign on it that reads &quot;Gold Room&quot;. Set in the mirrored wall, and nearly invisible is a third door, a small &quot;Staff&quot; sign attached to it.</p><br><p>There are several others in various states of fitness moving around, though not enough to make the place feel crowded.

      Calling this room the 'Gold Room' is a bit of a misnomer, the room it's self isn't actually gold. Rather it's a smallish room with mirrors on all the walls. Machines circle the outside of the room, with a break in the line for the door. The machines claim to do all kinds of strange things to your body, and studying them closely you can almost understand why the gym owner limits their use.</p><br><p>The first machine to your left is the one the ill-fated ass Erik demonstrated for you, the straps and levers inside the machine will, somehow, make you several inches taller when you use it.</p><br><p>The next machine looks a lot like a play-doh press, only person-sized. The sticker on it states that it will squeeze the fat out of your body, leaving you with as close to 0% body fat as it's possible to get.</p><br><p>Siting next to that one, looking for all the world like some kind of lewd sex machine is one which the label states will make your dick, assuming you have one, larger.</p><br><p>Unsurprisingly the next machine, which looks a lot like a steampunk bidet, claims to make the balls of anyone who uses it larger. You have to wonder why Erik didn't bother with it.</p><br><p>The next contraption is very odd looking, it seems to be a combination of the last two, but different in some way you can't really pin down just by looking. The label on this machine says that it will make your erections larger.</p><br><p>Next is a machine that you almost recognize, it looks like a thigh sculptor, only more advanced. This machine says that it will slim your hips and thighs.</p><br><p>Last, the machine directly to your right as you come in, is another nearly familiar machine. This machine appears to be an advanced squat machine, the label saying that it will give you a smaller, tighter butt.

      While you worked here you were never allowed into this room, you were pretty sure it was just an office since Bessie was usually in here when she was at the shop at all. Now that you can get in here you see that you were mostly correct. The area right inside the door looks like your typical office, a desk sits facing the door and covered in papers and files. An old computer monitor takes up one corner of the desk. You're pretty sure there's a keyboard somewhere under the papers, but you'd have to dig to find it. A pair of filing cabinets rest against the back wall, flanking the desk to either side.</p><br><p>Where the idea of a typical office breaks down is the area to the left of the desk. A raised lip separates the two areas and probably helps keep any spills from reaching the office or escaping out the door. The floor is tiled and gently slops towards the center where a drain is placed in the floor. Slightly offset from the center is a large wooden chair. It looks vaguely like a toilet, with a hole cut in the seat, but is lacking a bowl or tank. Instead it has long, very solid arms with straps hanging off them. The legs likewise have straps placed to go around the occupant's ankles. Behind the chair on a complicated hinge system is what appears to be an automatic milking machine, it looks like it can be moved over the chair and positioned in front of who ever is sitting in the chair. The hoses run to the far corner of the room where a large tank waits to be filled, there's also a machine next to the tank labeled 'Automatic Ice Cream Maker v2.0'
