      The street outside your apartment. Three identical buildings
      sit side-by-side here, they all share a single parking lot accessed by an
      alley. The lot is really too small for the number of apartments in the
      buildings but that's never bothered you since you don't have a car. Up
      the road a short distance from here is what's best described as the
      'market district' of this small town. Across from your building is the
      local park, the woods always look like it would be easy to get lost in
      them, even during the day. Down the road away from town is the new
      construction that's been going up, including the new club that just
      opened.

      a modern gym, you've never gone inside it before, but perhaps now it
      would be worth it to take a peek inside. North of here the road heads out
      of town eventually leading to the highway and the rest of the country.
      Before it gets that far, and still within walking distance, sits the
      town's hospital.

      to strengthen some aspect of your body. Each machine has a sign next to
      it with a visual description of how to use the machine as well as several
      warnings about using them correctly. The machines also seem to be grouped
      and numbered, it looks like if you pick a group and follow the numbers in
      sequence you'll get a good workout in that area.
      

      The back wall
      of the room is a large mirror, both letting you see yourself working out
      and giving the illusion that the room is much larger then it appears.
      There are three doors in the room, the first heads back out through the
      reception area and then outside. Across the room from that is another
      door secured with a card reader, it has a sign on it that
      reads "Gold Room". Set in the mirrored wall, and nearly
      invisible is a third door, a small "Staff" sign attached to
      it.
      

      There are several others in various states of fitness
      moving around, though not enough to make the place feel crowded.

  # DON'T FORGET TO PUT SHAY IN HERE, OMFG!
  desc:
    verbose: >-
      Calling this room the 'Gold Room' is a bit of a misnomer, the room
      it's self isn't actually gold. Rather it's a smallish room with mirrors
      on all the walls. Machines circle the outside of the room, with a break
      in the line for the door. The machines claim to do all kinds of strange
      things to your body, and studying them closely you can almost
      understand why the gym owner limits their use.
      

      The first
      machine to your left is the one the ill-fated ass Erik demonstrated for
      you, the straps and levers inside the machine will, somehow, make you
      several inches taller when you use it.
      

      The next machine looks
      a lot like a play-doh press, only person-sized. The sticker on it states
      that it will squeeze the fat out of your body, leaving you with as close
      to 0% body fat as it's possible to get.
      

      Siting next to that
      one, looking for all the world like some kind of lewd sex machine is
      one which the label states will make your dick, assuming you have one,
      larger.
      

      Unsurprisingly the next machine, which looks a lot like
      a steampunk bidet, claims to make the balls of anyone who uses it larger.
      You have to wonder why Erik didn't bother with it.
      

      The next
      contraption is very odd looking, it seems to be a combination of the
      last two, but different in some way you can't really pin down just by
      looking. The label on this machine says that it will make your erections
      larger.

      
      Next is a machine that you almost recognize, it looks
      like a thigh sculptor, only more advanced. This machine says that it will
      slim your hips and thighs.
      

      Last, the machine directly to your
      right as you come in, is another nearly familiar machine. This machine
      appears to be an advanced squat machine, the label saying that it will
      give you a smaller, tighter butt.

      opposite the door has a door and a window into which is the manager's
      office. Shay can usually be found somewhere in the area. Along side the
      window sits a vending machine mostly selling health drinks.
      

      The
      middle of the room is dominated by an impressive contraption, you can't
      fathom what all the parts are supposed to be used for. According to Shay,
      this machine is supposed to make your chest bigger. Also according to

      While you worked here you were never allowed into this room, you were
      pretty sure it was just an office since Bessie was usually in here when
      she was at the shop at all. Now that you can get in here you see that you
      were mostly correct. The area right inside the door looks like your
      typical office, a desk sits facing the door and covered in papers and
      files. An old computer monitor takes up one corner of the desk. You're
      pretty sure there's a keyboard somewhere under the papers, but you'd have
      to dig to find it. A pair of filing cabinets rest against the back wall,
      flanking the desk to either side.
      
      
      Where the idea of a typical
      office breaks down is the area to the left of the desk. A raised lip
      separates the two areas and probably helps keep any spills from
      reaching the office or escaping out the door. The floor is tiled and
      gently slops towards the center where a drain is placed in the floor.
      Slightly offset from the center is a large wooden chair. It looks
      vaguely like a toilet, with a hole cut in the seat, but is lacking a
      bowl or tank. Instead it has long, very solid arms with straps hanging
      off them. The legs likewise have straps placed to go around the
      occupant's ankles. Behind the chair on a complicated hinge system
      is what appears to be an automatic milking machine, it looks like it
      can be moved over the chair and positioned in front of who ever is
      sitting in the chair. The hoses run to the far corner of the room where a
      large tank waits to be filled, there's also a machine next to the tank
      labeled 'Automatic Ice Cream Maker v2.0'
