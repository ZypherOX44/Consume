This branch has the code for the abandoned treewalk interpreter in it.

In order to work at this, one would likely need to first rebase so that the
core engine code (against which the interpreter is meant to run) is current.

I may return to this, someday. But right now, I'm marking it dead so I can try
to get something actually shipped.

Best of wishes,
